    <img src="../images/tacobites.jpg">

    <p>I cannot belivee now one believes me when I say Taco Bites are
        real! You can make them, I promise! I used to DEVOUR taco bites
        every single day as a child. They literally never get old.
    </p>

    <p>It all started when I was about 8 years old. The playground
        burnt to the ground then subsequently melted into the 
        pavement. It was rough. The only thing that helped me was
        the fact that I knew I had roughly six dozen taco bites just waiting
        for me back home. They were already precooked and everything.
    </p>
    
    <p>Below I will describe in absolute incredibvle detail how
        to prepare, cook, and eat every single Taco Bite in existence.
