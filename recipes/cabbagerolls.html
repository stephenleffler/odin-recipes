    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Cabbage rolls are one of my favorite dishes. 
    As a small lad in the old country, my babushka would prepare
    this dish as a yearly tradition around the time of the new year.
    It would be considered a yearly rite of good luck and great
    fortune to consume cabbage upon the new year. Everyone in the 
    village would take part in the ritual.  
    </p>

    <p>While cabbage rolls are a relatively simple dish, early evidence
    has shown that peoples have been consuming them ritualistically
    for perhaps millions of years. The sacred rite of cabbage consumption
    has proven time and again that the curious cruciferous cuisine is
    the most sacred and longest practiced tradition in the history
    of mankind.

    <p>Below, I will outline a detailed recipe on exactly how to
        prepare and enjoy the leaves of The Ancient Ones.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Meat (Typically a grounded beef and/or sausage combination</li>
        <li>Tomato Sauce</li>
        <li>Tomato Base Paste</li>
        <li>White Rice or Jasmin Rice I guess</li>
        <li>Additional Cabbage (just in case)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix in the raw rice and onions into the meat</li>
        <li>Get it good and mixed and turn them into balls</li>
        <li>By balls I mean ball up the meat that has the onions and rice in it</li>
        <li>It's really more like a cylinder shape than a ball</li>
        <li>Prepare the Ancient Treat</li>
        <li>Wrap the meat concoction with the leaves of the gods</li>
        <li>Once is it wrapped, dig a huge pit</li>
        <li>Fill the pit with the red sauces (pastes, sauce, soups)</li>
        <li>Get the pit boiling (typically through Arcane means)</li>
        <li>Wrapped rolls of cab and meat go into the infernal pit</li>
        <li>They don't take long</li>
    </ol>
